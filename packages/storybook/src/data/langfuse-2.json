Use **separate fenced blocks** with language hints.\\n- **Code fences:** Use `bash`, `ini` (or `env`), `python`, `ts`, `json`. One purpose per block (install, env, file, run).\\n- **Filenames:** Show the intended filename in a short caption line before the block, e.g., `_hello.py_`.\\n- **Links:** Use descriptive markdown links for every doc reference; no bare URLs. Prefer canonical anchors.\\n- **Tables:** Use a 2-column table for environment variables (`Name | Value (example)`).\\n- **Sections to include (if relevant):** *Prerequisites* → *Setup* → *Minimal Example* → *Run* → *Troubleshooting* → *Links*.\\n- **Copy-ready:** Commands and examples must be copy-pastable with placeholders clearly marked like `<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>`.\\n- **Keep it tight:** ≤ 20 lines of code per SDK section.

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\\\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\\\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\u201d).\\\\\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\\\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\\\\\u201cRuns\\\\\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return answer\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\\\\\n with item.run(\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.\\\\\\\\nLast updated on August 20, 2025\\\\\\\\n[Instrumentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Instrumentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n[Advanced usage](/docs/observability/sdk/python/advanced-usage \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Advanced usage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nWas this page helpful?\\\\\\\\nYesNo\\\\\\\\n[Support](/support)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}], \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\"}}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"document\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"record_type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"documentation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-11-21-all-new-datasets-and-evals-documentation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"All new Datasets, Experimentation and Evaluation documentation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"## New Datasets and Evaluation documentation\\\\\\\\nBased on this week\\\\\\\\u2019s changes, we have have restructured the documentation to:\\\\\\\\n  1.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\\\\\nThey are called \\\\\\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\\\\\u201cremote\\\\\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n]\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nimport {\\\\\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\\\\\n} from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize client\\\\\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n];\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Define your task function\\\\\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\\\\\n model: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n messages: [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n role: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n content: question,\\\\\\\\n },\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n });\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response;\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: localData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task=my_task\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task: myTask\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: testData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics.

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

Run your evaluations\\\\\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence. You can identify with ease the\\\\\\\\n tone in human-written text. Your task is to identify the tones present in a\\\\\\\\n piece of <text/> with precission. Your output is a comma separated list of three\\\\\\\\n tones. PRINT THE LIST ALONE, NOTHING ELSE.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<possible_tones>\\\\\\\\nneutral, confident, joyful, optimistic, friendly, urgent, analytical, respectful\\\\\\\\n</possible_tones>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<example_1>\\\\\\\\nInput: Citizen science plays a crucial role in research by involving everyday\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\npeople in scientific projects.

However, excessive use of social media can also lead to\\\\\\\\nfeelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and anxiety. It's important to find a\\\\\\\\nbalance and be mindful of how social media affects your mental well-being.\\\\\\\\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental health.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOutput: friendly,neutral,respectful\\\\\\\\n</example_3>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<text>\\\\\\\\n{text}\\\\\\\\n</text>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntest_tone_score = openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(\\\\\\\\n text=traces_batch[1].output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"User query: {traces_batch[1].input['args'][0]}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Model answer: {traces_batch[1].output}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dominant tones: {test_tone_score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIdentifying human intents and tones can be tricky for language models. To handle this, we used a multi-shot prompt, which means giving the model several examples to learn from. Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s wrap our code in an evaluation function for convenience.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef tone_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n return openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(text=trace.output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n ).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntone_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nGreat! Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\\\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\\\\\u2019 score.\\\\\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\\\\\nNow we\\\\\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\\\\\u2019s time to put them to work. Use the Langfuse client to add scores to existing traces.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nlangfuse.create_score(\\\\\\\\n trace_id=traces_batch[1].id,\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n comment=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nAnd thus, you\\\\\\\\u2019ve added your first externally-evaluated score to Langfuse! Just 49 more to go \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\ude01. But don\\\\\\\\u2019t worry \\\\\\\\u2014 our solutions are easy to scale.\\\\\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Putting everything together\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nUntil now, we went through each of the necessary steps to build an external evaluation pipeline: Fetching traces, running the evaluations, and persisting the scores to Langfuse. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up.

When JsonPath is empty, the backend uses the top-level value as-is, but if the field is a string and the mapping expects an object (or vice versa), the item is excluded from evaluation\\\\\\\\u00a0[see code logic](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/98cc1bb7a1759e29de3dd818f6a500df48fb5e82/worker/src/features/evaluation/evalService.ts).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry this: map all variables to fields you know are plain strings (like Input or Expected Output) and see if the evaluation processes any items. If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath. This will help isolate the problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you still get 0 elements, export a sample of your dataset as JSON and share it\\\\\\\\u2014there may be a subtle data or mapping mismatch. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nMore details on dataset item structure and mapping: [Langfuse docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/get-started).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\\\\\\\\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n<sup>How did I do?

Here are the key benefits:\\\\\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\\\\\\\\n  * **Risk Mitigation** : Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\\\\\\\\n## Online & Offline Evaluation\\\\\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\\\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\\\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\u201d).\\\\\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\\\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\\\\\u201cRuns\\\\\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return answer\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\\\\\n with item.run(\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\\\\\nThey are called \\\\\\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\\\\\u201cremote\\\\\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n]\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nimport {\\\\\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\\\\\n} from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize client\\\\\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n];\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Define your task function\\\\\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\\\\\n model: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n messages: [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n role: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n content: question,\\\\\\\\n },\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n });\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response;\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: localData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task=my_task\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task: myTask\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: testData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics.

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

We\\\\\\\\u2019ll generate a variety of potential questions that real users might ask. While this is a great way to kickstart your LLM development, collecting real user queries as soon as possible is invaluable.\\\\\\\\nYou can get your Langfuse API keys [here](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) and OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n%pip install langfuse openai deepeval --upgrade\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport os\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pk-lf-...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sk-lf-...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # \\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddea\\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddfa EU region\\\\\\\\n///# os.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # \\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddfa\\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddf8 US region\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Your openai key\\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sk-proj-...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and generate a list of topic suggestions that we can later query to our application.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport openai\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntopic_suggestion = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" You're a world-class journalist, specialized\\\\\\\\nin figuring out which are the topics that excite people the most.\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nBATCH_SIZE = 10\\\\\\\\nTOTAL_TRACES = 50\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nnow = datetime.now()\\\\\\\\nfive_am_today = datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day, 5, 0)\\\\\\\\nfive_am_yesterday = five_am_today - timedelta(days=1)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntraces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(page=1,\\\\\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE,\\\\\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\\\\\n to_timestamp=datetime.now()\\\\\\\\n ).data\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Traces in first batch: {len(traces_batch)}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nTraces in first batch: 10\\\\\\\\n## 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Run your evaluations\\\\\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence. You can identify with ease the\\\\\\\\n tone in human-written text. Your task is to identify the tones present in a\\\\\\\\n piece of <text/> with precission. Your output is a comma separated list of three\\\\\\\\n tones. PRINT THE LIST ALONE, NOTHING ELSE.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<possible_tones>\\\\\\\\nneutral, confident, joyful, optimistic, friendly, urgent, analytical, respectful\\\\\\\\n</possible_tones>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<example_1>\\\\\\\\nInput: Citizen science plays a crucial role in research by involving everyday\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\npeople in scientific projects.

It's important to find a\\\\\\\\nbalance and be mindful of how social media affects your mental well-being.\\\\\\\\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental health.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOutput: friendly,neutral,respectful\\\\\\\\n</example_3>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<text>\\\\\\\\n{text}\\\\\\\\n</text>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntest_tone_score = openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(\\\\\\\\n text=traces_batch[1].output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"User query: {traces_batch[1].input['args'][0]}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Model answer: {traces_batch[1].output}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dominant tones: {test_tone_score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIdentifying human intents and tones can be tricky for language models. To handle this, we used a multi-shot prompt, which means giving the model several examples to learn from. Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s wrap our code in an evaluation function for convenience.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef tone_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n return openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(text=trace.output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n ).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntone_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nGreat! Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\\\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\\\\\u2019 score.\\\\\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\\\\\nNow we\\\\\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\\\\\u2019s time to put them to work.

Let\\\\\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up. Batching not only reduces the memory load on your system but also allows you to create checkpoints, so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport math\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nfor page_number in range(1, math.ceil(TOTAL_TRACES/BATCH_SIZE)):\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n traces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(\\\\\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n page=page_number,\\\\\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\\\\\n to_timestamp=five_am_today,\\\\\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE\\\\\\\\n ).data\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n for trace in traces_batch:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Processing {trace.name}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n if trace.output is None:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Warning: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Trace {trace.name} had no generated output, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n it was skipped\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n continue\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value=tone_score(trace)\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n jscore = joyfulness_score(trace)\\\\\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"joyfulness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value=jscore[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n comment=jscore[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Batch {page_number} processed \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\ude80 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIf your pipeline ran successfully, you should see your score in the Langfuse UI. \\\\\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\\\u2019s it!

When JsonPath is empty, the backend uses the top-level value as-is, but if the field is a string and the mapping expects an object (or vice versa), the item is excluded from evaluation\\\\\\\\u00a0[see code logic](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/98cc1bb7a1759e29de3dd818f6a500df48fb5e82/worker/src/features/evaluation/evalService.ts).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry this: map all variables to fields you know are plain strings (like Input or Expected Output) and see if the evaluation processes any items. If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath.

Here are the key benefits:\\\\\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\\\\\\\\n  * **Risk Mitigation** : Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\\\\\\\\n## Online & Offline Evaluation\\\\\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\u201d).\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\u201cRuns\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\n \\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\"\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\n \\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\",\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\n \\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return answer\\\\n \\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\n \\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\n with item.run(\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\n \\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\"],\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\"],\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.\\\\nLast updated on August 20, 2025\\\\n[Instrumentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation \\\\\\\"Instrumentation\\\\\\\")\\\\n[Advanced usage](/docs/observability/sdk/python/advanced-usage \\\\\\\"Advanced usage\\\\\\\")\\\\nWas this page helpful?\\\\nYesNo\\\\n[Support](/support)\\\\n\\\"}], \\\"type\\\": \\\"content\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"document\\\", \\\"record_type\\\": \\\"documentation\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-11-21-all-new-datasets-and-evals-documentation\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"All new Datasets, Experimentation and Evaluation documentation\\\", \\\"source\\\": {\\\"content\\\": [{\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"## New Datasets and Evaluation documentation\\\\nBased on this week\\\\u2019s changes, we have have restructured the documentation to:\\\\n  1.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\nThey are called \\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\u201cremote\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\n \\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\n \\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\"]\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n]\\\\n \\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\nimport {\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\n} from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize client\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n];\\\\n \\\\n// Define your task function\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\n \\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\n model: \\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\",\\\\n messages: [\\\\n {\\\\n role: \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n content: question,\\\\n },\\\\n ],\\\\n });\\\\n \\\\n return response;\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: localData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\n```\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task=my_task\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\");\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task: myTask\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\n```\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\n \\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n }\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: testData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n```\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics.

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\n* * *\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\n* * *\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

We\\\\u2019ll generate a variety of potential questions that real users might ask. While this is a great way to kickstart your LLM development, collecting real user queries as soon as possible is invaluable.\\\\nYou can get your Langfuse API keys [here](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) and OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n%pip install langfuse openai deepeval --upgrade\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport os\\\\n \\\\n///# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"pk-lf-...\\\\\\\" \\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"sk-lf-...\\\\\\\" \\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\" # \\\\ud83c\\\\uddea\\\\ud83c\\\\uddfa EU region\\\\n///# os.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\" # \\\\ud83c\\\\uddfa\\\\ud83c\\\\uddf8 US region\\\\n \\\\n///# Your openai key\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"sk-proj-...\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s go ahead and generate a list of topic suggestions that we can later query to our application.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport openai\\\\n \\\\ntopic_suggestion = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" You're a world-class journalist, specialized\\\\nin figuring out which are the topics that excite people the most.\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nBATCH_SIZE = 10\\\\nTOTAL_TRACES = 50\\\\n \\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\n \\\\nnow = datetime.now()\\\\nfive_am_today = datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day, 5, 0)\\\\nfive_am_yesterday = five_am_today - timedelta(days=1)\\\\n \\\\ntraces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(page=1,\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE,\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\n to_timestamp=datetime.now()\\\\n ).data\\\\n \\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"Traces in first batch: {len(traces_batch)}\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nTraces in first batch: 10\\\\n## 2\\\\\\\\. Run your evaluations\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\nWe\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence. You can identify with ease the\\\\n tone in human-written text. Your task is to identify the tones present in a\\\\n piece of <text/> with precission. Your output is a comma separated list of three\\\\n tones. PRINT THE LIST ALONE, NOTHING ELSE.\\\\n \\\\n<possible_tones>\\\\nneutral, confident, joyful, optimistic, friendly, urgent, analytical, respectful\\\\n</possible_tones>\\\\n \\\\n<example_1>\\\\nInput: Citizen science plays a crucial role in research by involving everyday\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\npeople in scientific projects. This collaboration allows researchers to collect\\\\nvast amounts of data that would be impossible to gather on their own. Citizen\\\\nscientists contribute valuable observations and insights that can lead to new\\\\ndiscoveries and advancements in various fields. By participating in citizen\\\\nscience projects, individuals can actively contribute to scientific research\\\\nand make a meaningful impact on our understanding of the world around us.\\\\n \\\\nOutput: respectful,optimistic,confident\\\\n</example_1>\\\\n \\\\n<example_2>\\\\nInput: Bionics is a field that combines biology and engineering to create\\\\ndevices that can enhance human abilities.

It's important to find a\\\\nbalance and be mindful of how social media affects your mental well-being.\\\\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental health.\\\\n \\\\nOutput: friendly,neutral,respectful\\\\n</example_3>\\\\n \\\\n<text>\\\\n{text}\\\\n</text>\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n \\\\ntest_tone_score = openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\n messages=[\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(\\\\n text=traces_batch[1].output),\\\\n }\\\\n ],\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\n temperature=0\\\\n).choices[0].message.content\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"User query: {traces_batch[1].input['args'][0]}\\\\\\\")\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"Model answer: {traces_batch[1].output}\\\\\\\")\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"Dominant tones: {test_tone_score}\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nIdentifying human intents and tones can be tricky for language models. To handle this, we used a multi-shot prompt, which means giving the model several examples to learn from. Now let\\\\u2019s wrap our code in an evaluation function for convenience.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\ndef tone_score(trace):\\\\n return openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\n messages=[\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(text=trace.output),\\\\n }\\\\n ],\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\",\\\\n temperature=0\\\\n ).choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\ntone_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\n```\\\\nGreat! Now let\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\u2019 score.\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\n \\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\",\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\",\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\n )\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\"],\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\n \\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\")\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n return {\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\n \\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\n```\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\nNow we\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\u2019s time to put them to work. Use the Langfuse client to add scores to existing traces.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nlangfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=traces_batch[1].id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\nAnd thus, you\\\\u2019ve added your first externally-evaluated score to Langfuse! Just 49 more to go \\\\ud83d\\\\ude01. But don\\\\u2019t worry \\\\u2014 our solutions are easy to scale.\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\. Putting everything together\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nUntil now, we went through each of the necessary steps to build an external evaluation pipeline: Fetching traces, running the evaluations, and persisting the scores to Langfuse. Let\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up. Batching not only reduces the memory load on your system but also allows you to create checkpoints, so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport math\\\\n \\\\nfor page_number in range(1, math.ceil(TOTAL_TRACES/BATCH_SIZE)):\\\\n \\\\n traces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\n page=page_number,\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\n to_timestamp=five_am_today,\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE\\\\n ).data\\\\n \\\\n for trace in traces_batch:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Processing {trace.name}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n if trace.output is None:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Warning: \\\\\\\\n Trace {trace.name} had no generated output, \\\\\\\\\\\\n it was skipped\\\\\\\")\\\\n continue\\\\n \\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=tone_score(trace)\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n jscore = joyfulness_score(trace)\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"joyfulness\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=jscore[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=jscore[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Batch {page_number} processed \\\\ud83d\\\\ude80 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nIf your pipeline ran successfully, you should see your score in the Langfuse UI. \\\\nAnd that\\\\u2019s it! You\\\\u2019re now ready to integrate these lines into your preferred orchestration tool to ensure they run at the right times.\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nTo achieve our original goal of running the script every day at 5 am, simply schedule a Cron task in your chosen environment with the rule `cron(0 5 * * ? *)`.\\\\nThanks for coding along!

When JsonPath is empty, the backend uses the top-level value as-is, but if the field is a string and the mapping expects an object (or vice versa), the item is excluded from evaluation\\\\u00a0[see code logic](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/98cc1bb7a1759e29de3dd818f6a500df48fb5e82/worker/src/features/evaluation/evalService.ts).\\\\n\\\\nTry this: map all variables to fields you know are plain strings (like Input or Expected Output) and see if the evaluation processes any items. If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath. This will help isolate the problem.\\\\n\\\\nIf you still get 0 elements, export a sample of your dataset as JSON and share it\\\\u2014there may be a subtle data or mapping mismatch. \\\\n\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nMore details on dataset item structure and mapping: [Langfuse docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/get-started).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\\\\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n<sup>How did I do?

\\\"Evaluation of LLM Applications - Langfuse\\\\nDocsEvaluationOverview\\\\nCopy as Markdown\\\\n# Evaluation Overview\\\\nEvaluation is a critical aspect of developing and deploying LLM applications. Usually, teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods to score the performance of their AI application depending on the use case and the stage of the development process.\\\\n\\\\ud83c\\\\udfa5\\\\n[ **Watch this walkthrough**](/watch-demo?tab=evaluation) of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\\\\n## Why use LLM Evaluation?\\\\nLLM evaluation is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, ultimately enhancing the user experience and trust in your AI application. Here are the key benefits:\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\\\\n  * **Risk Mitigation** : Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\\\\n## Online & Offline Evaluation\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy metrics since you have ground truth.\\\\n**Online

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\u201d).\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\u201cRuns\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\n \\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\"\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\n \\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\",\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\n \\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return answer\\\\n \\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\n \\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\n with item.run(\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\n \\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\"],\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\"],\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.\\\\nLast updated on August 20, 2025\\\\n[Instrumentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation \\\\\\\"Instrumentation\\\\\\\")\\\\n[Advanced usage](/docs/observability/sdk/python/advanced-usage \\\\\\\"Advanced usage\\\\\\\")\\\\nWas this page helpful?\\\\nYesNo\\\\n[Support](/support)\\\\n\\\"}], \\\"type\\\": \\\"content\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"document\\\", \\\"record_type\\\": \\\"documentation\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-11-21-all-new-datasets-and-evals-documentation\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"All new Datasets, Experimentation and Evaluation documentation\\\", \\\"source\\\": {\\\"content\\\": [{\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"## New Datasets and Evaluation documentation\\\\nBased on this week\\\\u2019s changes, we have have restructured the documentation to:\\\\n  1.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\nThey are called \\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\u201cremote\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\n \\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\n \\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\"]\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n]\\\\n \\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\nimport {\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\n} from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize client\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n];\\\\n \\\\n// Define your task function\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\n \\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\n model: \\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\",\\\\n messages: [\\\\n {\\\\n role: \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n content: question,\\\\n },\\\\n ],\\\\n });\\\\n \\\\n return response;\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: localData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\n```\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task=my_task\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\");\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task: myTask\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\n```\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\n \\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n }\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: testData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n```\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics. When run on Langfuse datasets, these scores are attached to the full dataset run for tracking overall experiment performance.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\n \\\\ndef average_accuracy(*, item_results, **kwargs):\\\\n \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Calculate average accuracy across all items\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n accuracies = [\\\\n eval.value for result in item_results\\\\n for eval in result.evaluations\\\\n if eval.name == \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\"\\\\n ]\\\\n \\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n if not accuracies:\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\", value=None)\\\\n \\\\n avg = sum(accuracies) / len(accuracies)\\\\n \\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\", value=avg, comment=f\\\\\\\"Average accuracy: {avg:.2%}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Comprehensive Analysis\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator],\\\\n run_evaluators=[average_accuracy]\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nconst averageAccuracy = async ({ itemResults }) => {\\\\n // Calculate average accuracy across all items\\\\n const accuracies = itemResults\\\\n .flatMap(result => result.evaluations)\\\\n .filter(evaluation => evaluation.name === \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\")\\\\n .map(evaluation => evaluation.value as number);\\\\n \\\\n if (accuracies.length === 0) {\\\\n return { name: \\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\", value: null };\\\\n }\\\\n \\\\n const avg = accuracies.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / accuracies.length;\\\\n \\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: avg,\\\\n comment: `Average accuracy: ${(avg * 100).toFixed(1)}%`\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Comprehensive Analysis\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: testData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator],\\\\n runEvaluators: [averageAccuracy]\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n```\\\\n#### Async Tasks and Evaluators\\\\nBoth task functions and evaluators can be asynchronous.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport asyncio\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import AsyncOpenAI\\\\n \\\\nasync def async_llm_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\n \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Async task using OpenAI\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n client = AsyncOpenAI()\\\\n response = await client.chat.completions.create(\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4\\\\\\\",\\\\n messages=[{\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": item[\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\"]}]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\n///# Works seamlessly with async functions\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Async Experiment\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=async_llm_task,\\\\n max_concurrency=5 #

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\n* * *\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\n* * *\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

Run your evaluations\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\nWe\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence.

Now let\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\u2019 score.\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\n \\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\",\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\",\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\n )\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\"],\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\n \\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\")\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n return {\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\n \\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\n```\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\nNow we\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\u2019s time to put them to work. Use the Langfuse client to add scores to existing traces.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nlangfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=traces_batch[1].id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\nAnd thus, you\\\\u2019ve added your first externally-evaluated score to Langfuse! Just 49 more to go \\\\ud83d\\\\ude01. But don\\\\u2019t worry \\\\u2014 our solutions are easy to scale.\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\. Putting everything together\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nUntil now, we went through each of the necessary steps to build an external evaluation pipeline: Fetching traces, running the evaluations, and persisting the scores to Langfuse. Let\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up. Batching not only reduces the memory load on your system but also allows you to create checkpoints, so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport math\\\\n \\\\nfor page_number in range(1, math.ceil(TOTAL_TRACES/BATCH_SIZE)):\\\\n \\\\n traces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\n page=page_number,\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\n to_timestamp=five_am_today,\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE\\\\n ).data\\\\n \\\\n for trace in traces_batch:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Processing {trace.name}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n if trace.output is None:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Warning: \\\\\\\\n Trace {trace.name} had no generated output, \\\\\\\\\\\\n it was skipped\\\\\\\")\\\\n continue\\\\n \\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=tone_score(trace)\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n jscore = joyfulness_score(trace)\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"joyfulness\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=jscore[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=jscore[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Batch {page_number} processed \\\\ud83d\\\\ude80 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nIf your pipeline ran successfully, you should see your score in the Langfuse UI. \\\\nAnd that\\\\u2019s it! You\\\\u2019re now ready to integrate these lines into your preferred orchestration tool to ensure they run at the right times.\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nTo achieve our original goal of running the script every day at 5 am, simply schedule a Cron task in your chosen environment with the rule `cron(0 5 * * ? *)`.\\\\nThanks for coding along!

If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath.

applications. Usually, teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods to score the performance of their AI application depending on the use case and the stage of the development process.\\\\n\\\\ud83c\\\\udfa5\\\\n[ **Watch this walkthrough**](/watch-demo?tab=evaluation) of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\\\\n## Why use LLM Evaluation?\\\\nLLM evaluation is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, ultimately enhancing the user experience and trust in your AI application. Here are the key benefits:\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic

Use **separate fenced blocks** with language hints.\\n- **Code fences:** Use `bash`, `ini` (or `env`), `python`, `ts`, `json`. One purpose per block (install, env, file, run).\\n- **Filenames:** Show the intended filename in a short caption line before the block, e.g., `_hello.py_`.\\n- **Links:** Use descriptive markdown links for every doc reference; no bare URLs. Prefer canonical anchors.\\n- **Tables:** Use a 2-column table for environment variables (`Name | Value (example)`).\\n- **Sections to include (if relevant):** *Prerequisites* → *Setup* → *Minimal Example* → *Run* → *Troubleshooting* → *Links*.\\n- **Copy-ready:** Commands and examples must be copy-pastable with placeholders clearly marked like `<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>`.\\n- **Keep it tight:** ≤ 20 lines of code per SDK section.

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\\\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\\\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\u201d).\\\\\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\\\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\\\\\u201cRuns\\\\\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return answer\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\\\\\n with item.run(\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.\\\\\\\\nLast updated on August 20, 2025\\\\\\\\n[Instrumentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Instrumentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n[Advanced usage](/docs/observability/sdk/python/advanced-usage \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Advanced usage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nWas this page helpful?\\\\\\\\nYesNo\\\\\\\\n[Support](/support)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}], \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\"}}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"document\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"record_type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"documentation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-11-21-all-new-datasets-and-evals-documentation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"All new Datasets, Experimentation and Evaluation documentation\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"## New Datasets and Evaluation documentation\\\\\\\\nBased on this week\\\\\\\\u2019s changes, we have have restructured the documentation to:\\\\\\\\n  1.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\\\\\nThey are called \\\\\\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\\\\\u201cremote\\\\\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n]\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nimport {\\\\\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\\\\\n} from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize client\\\\\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n];\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Define your task function\\\\\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\\\\\n model: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n messages: [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n role: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n content: question,\\\\\\\\n },\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n });\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response;\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: localData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task=my_task\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task: myTask\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: testData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics.

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

Run your evaluations\\\\\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence. You can identify with ease the\\\\\\\\n tone in human-written text. Your task is to identify the tones present in a\\\\\\\\n piece of <text/> with precission. Your output is a comma separated list of three\\\\\\\\n tones. PRINT THE LIST ALONE, NOTHING ELSE.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<possible_tones>\\\\\\\\nneutral, confident, joyful, optimistic, friendly, urgent, analytical, respectful\\\\\\\\n</possible_tones>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<example_1>\\\\\\\\nInput: Citizen science plays a crucial role in research by involving everyday\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\npeople in scientific projects.

However, excessive use of social media can also lead to\\\\\\\\nfeelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and anxiety. It's important to find a\\\\\\\\nbalance and be mindful of how social media affects your mental well-being.\\\\\\\\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental health.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOutput: friendly,neutral,respectful\\\\\\\\n</example_3>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<text>\\\\\\\\n{text}\\\\\\\\n</text>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntest_tone_score = openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(\\\\\\\\n text=traces_batch[1].output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"User query: {traces_batch[1].input['args'][0]}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Model answer: {traces_batch[1].output}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dominant tones: {test_tone_score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIdentifying human intents and tones can be tricky for language models. To handle this, we used a multi-shot prompt, which means giving the model several examples to learn from. Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s wrap our code in an evaluation function for convenience.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef tone_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n return openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(text=trace.output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n ).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntone_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nGreat! Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\\\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\\\\\u2019 score.\\\\\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\\\\\nNow we\\\\\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\\\\\u2019s time to put them to work. Use the Langfuse client to add scores to existing traces.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nlangfuse.create_score(\\\\\\\\n trace_id=traces_batch[1].id,\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n comment=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nAnd thus, you\\\\\\\\u2019ve added your first externally-evaluated score to Langfuse! Just 49 more to go \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\ude01. But don\\\\\\\\u2019t worry \\\\\\\\u2014 our solutions are easy to scale.\\\\\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Putting everything together\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nUntil now, we went through each of the necessary steps to build an external evaluation pipeline: Fetching traces, running the evaluations, and persisting the scores to Langfuse. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up.

When JsonPath is empty, the backend uses the top-level value as-is, but if the field is a string and the mapping expects an object (or vice versa), the item is excluded from evaluation\\\\\\\\u00a0[see code logic](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/98cc1bb7a1759e29de3dd818f6a500df48fb5e82/worker/src/features/evaluation/evalService.ts).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry this: map all variables to fields you know are plain strings (like Input or Expected Output) and see if the evaluation processes any items. If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath. This will help isolate the problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you still get 0 elements, export a sample of your dataset as JSON and share it\\\\\\\\u2014there may be a subtle data or mapping mismatch. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nMore details on dataset item structure and mapping: [Langfuse docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/get-started).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\\\\\\\\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n<sup>How did I do?

Here are the key benefits:\\\\\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\\\\\\\\n  * **Risk Mitigation** : Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\\\\\\\\n## Online & Offline Evaluation\\\\\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\\\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\\\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\\u201d).\\\\\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\\\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\\\\\u201cRuns\\\\\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\\\\\n input={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": context},\\\\\\\\n output={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return answer\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\\\\\n with item.run(\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\\\\\nThey are called \\\\\\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\\\\\u201cremote\\\\\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\n]\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nimport {\\\\\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\\\\\n} from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Initialize client\\\\\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" },\\\\\\\\n];\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Define your task function\\\\\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\\\\\n model: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n messages: [\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n role: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n content: question,\\\\\\\\n },\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n });\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return response;\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: localData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task=my_task\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n description: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n task: myTask\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\\\\\n };\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\\\\\n name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n data: testData,\\\\\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics.

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

We\\\\\\\\u2019ll generate a variety of potential questions that real users might ask. While this is a great way to kickstart your LLM development, collecting real user queries as soon as possible is invaluable.\\\\\\\\nYou can get your Langfuse API keys [here](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) and OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n%pip install langfuse openai deepeval --upgrade\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport os\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pk-lf-...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sk-lf-...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # \\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddea\\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddfa EU region\\\\\\\\n///# os.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # \\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddfa\\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddf8 US region\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n///# Your openai key\\\\\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sk-proj-...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and generate a list of topic suggestions that we can later query to our application.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport openai\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntopic_suggestion = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" You're a world-class journalist, specialized\\\\\\\\nin figuring out which are the topics that excite people the most.\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nBATCH_SIZE = 10\\\\\\\\nTOTAL_TRACES = 50\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nnow = datetime.now()\\\\\\\\nfive_am_today = datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day, 5, 0)\\\\\\\\nfive_am_yesterday = five_am_today - timedelta(days=1)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntraces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(page=1,\\\\\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE,\\\\\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\\\\\n to_timestamp=datetime.now()\\\\\\\\n ).data\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Traces in first batch: {len(traces_batch)}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nTraces in first batch: 10\\\\\\\\n## 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Run your evaluations\\\\\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence. You can identify with ease the\\\\\\\\n tone in human-written text. Your task is to identify the tones present in a\\\\\\\\n piece of <text/> with precission. Your output is a comma separated list of three\\\\\\\\n tones. PRINT THE LIST ALONE, NOTHING ELSE.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<possible_tones>\\\\\\\\nneutral, confident, joyful, optimistic, friendly, urgent, analytical, respectful\\\\\\\\n</possible_tones>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<example_1>\\\\\\\\nInput: Citizen science plays a crucial role in research by involving everyday\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\npeople in scientific projects.

It's important to find a\\\\\\\\nbalance and be mindful of how social media affects your mental well-being.\\\\\\\\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental health.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOutput: friendly,neutral,respectful\\\\\\\\n</example_3>\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n<text>\\\\\\\\n{text}\\\\\\\\n</text>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntest_tone_score = openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(\\\\\\\\n text=traces_batch[1].output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"User query: {traces_batch[1].input['args'][0]}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Model answer: {traces_batch[1].output}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dominant tones: {test_tone_score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIdentifying human intents and tones can be tricky for language models. To handle this, we used a multi-shot prompt, which means giving the model several examples to learn from. Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s wrap our code in an evaluation function for convenience.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef tone_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n return openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\\\\\n messages=[\\\\\\\\n {\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(text=trace.output),\\\\\\\\n }\\\\\\\\n ],\\\\\\\\n model=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n temperature=0\\\\\\\\n ).choices[0].message.content\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ntone_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nGreat! Now let\\\\\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\\\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\\\\\u2019 score.\\\\\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"}, {\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n return {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\\\\\nNow we\\\\\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\\\\\u2019s time to put them to work.

Let\\\\\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up. Batching not only reduces the memory load on your system but also allows you to create checkpoints, so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport math\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nfor page_number in range(1, math.ceil(TOTAL_TRACES/BATCH_SIZE)):\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n traces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(\\\\\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n page=page_number,\\\\\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\\\\\n to_timestamp=five_am_today,\\\\\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE\\\\\\\\n ).data\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n for trace in traces_batch:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Processing {trace.name}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n if trace.output is None:\\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Warning: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Trace {trace.name} had no generated output, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n it was skipped\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n continue\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value=tone_score(trace)\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n jscore = joyfulness_score(trace)\\\\\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\\\\\n name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"joyfulness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n value=jscore[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n comment=jscore[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\n )\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Batch {page_number} processed \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\ude80 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIf your pipeline ran successfully, you should see your score in the Langfuse UI. \\\\\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\\\u2019s it!

When JsonPath is empty, the backend uses the top-level value as-is, but if the field is a string and the mapping expects an object (or vice versa), the item is excluded from evaluation\\\\\\\\u00a0[see code logic](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/98cc1bb7a1759e29de3dd818f6a500df48fb5e82/worker/src/features/evaluation/evalService.ts).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry this: map all variables to fields you know are plain strings (like Input or Expected Output) and see if the evaluation processes any items. If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath.

Here are the key benefits:\\\\\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\\\\\\\\n  * **Risk Mitigation** : Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\\\\\\\\n## Online & Offline Evaluation\\\\\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\u201d).\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\u201cRuns\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\n \\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\"\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\n \\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\",\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\n \\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return answer\\\\n \\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\n \\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\n with item.run(\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\n \\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\"],\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\"],\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.\\\\nLast updated on August 20, 2025\\\\n[Instrumentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation \\\\\\\"Instrumentation\\\\\\\")\\\\n[Advanced usage](/docs/observability/sdk/python/advanced-usage \\\\\\\"Advanced usage\\\\\\\")\\\\nWas this page helpful?\\\\nYesNo\\\\n[Support](/support)\\\\n\\\"}], \\\"type\\\": \\\"content\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"document\\\", \\\"record_type\\\": \\\"documentation\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-11-21-all-new-datasets-and-evals-documentation\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"All new Datasets, Experimentation and Evaluation documentation\\\", \\\"source\\\": {\\\"content\\\": [{\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"## New Datasets and Evaluation documentation\\\\nBased on this week\\\\u2019s changes, we have have restructured the documentation to:\\\\n  1.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\nThey are called \\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\u201cremote\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\n \\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\n \\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\"]\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n]\\\\n \\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\nimport {\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\n} from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize client\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n];\\\\n \\\\n// Define your task function\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\n \\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\n model: \\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\",\\\\n messages: [\\\\n {\\\\n role: \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n content: question,\\\\n },\\\\n ],\\\\n });\\\\n \\\\n return response;\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: localData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\n```\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task=my_task\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\");\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task: myTask\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\n```\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\n \\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n }\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: testData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n```\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics.

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\n* * *\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\n* * *\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

We\\\\u2019ll generate a variety of potential questions that real users might ask. While this is a great way to kickstart your LLM development, collecting real user queries as soon as possible is invaluable.\\\\nYou can get your Langfuse API keys [here](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) and OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n%pip install langfuse openai deepeval --upgrade\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport os\\\\n \\\\n///# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"pk-lf-...\\\\\\\" \\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"sk-lf-...\\\\\\\" \\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\" # \\\\ud83c\\\\uddea\\\\ud83c\\\\uddfa EU region\\\\n///# os.environ[\\\\\\\"LANGFUSE_HOST\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"https://us.cloud.langfuse.com\\\\\\\" # \\\\ud83c\\\\uddfa\\\\ud83c\\\\uddf8 US region\\\\n \\\\n///# Your openai key\\\\nos.environ[\\\\\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"sk-proj-...\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s go ahead and generate a list of topic suggestions that we can later query to our application.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport openai\\\\n \\\\ntopic_suggestion = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" You're a world-class journalist, specialized\\\\nin figuring out which are the topics that excite people the most.\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nBATCH_SIZE = 10\\\\nTOTAL_TRACES = 50\\\\n \\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\n \\\\nnow = datetime.now()\\\\nfive_am_today = datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day, 5, 0)\\\\nfive_am_yesterday = five_am_today - timedelta(days=1)\\\\n \\\\ntraces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(page=1,\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE,\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\n to_timestamp=datetime.now()\\\\n ).data\\\\n \\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"Traces in first batch: {len(traces_batch)}\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nTraces in first batch: 10\\\\n## 2\\\\\\\\. Run your evaluations\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\nWe\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence. You can identify with ease the\\\\n tone in human-written text. Your task is to identify the tones present in a\\\\n piece of <text/> with precission. Your output is a comma separated list of three\\\\n tones. PRINT THE LIST ALONE, NOTHING ELSE.\\\\n \\\\n<possible_tones>\\\\nneutral, confident, joyful, optimistic, friendly, urgent, analytical, respectful\\\\n</possible_tones>\\\\n \\\\n<example_1>\\\\nInput: Citizen science plays a crucial role in research by involving everyday\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\npeople in scientific projects. This collaboration allows researchers to collect\\\\nvast amounts of data that would be impossible to gather on their own. Citizen\\\\nscientists contribute valuable observations and insights that can lead to new\\\\ndiscoveries and advancements in various fields. By participating in citizen\\\\nscience projects, individuals can actively contribute to scientific research\\\\nand make a meaningful impact on our understanding of the world around us.\\\\n \\\\nOutput: respectful,optimistic,confident\\\\n</example_1>\\\\n \\\\n<example_2>\\\\nInput: Bionics is a field that combines biology and engineering to create\\\\ndevices that can enhance human abilities.

It's important to find a\\\\nbalance and be mindful of how social media affects your mental well-being.\\\\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental health.\\\\n \\\\nOutput: friendly,neutral,respectful\\\\n</example_3>\\\\n \\\\n<text>\\\\n{text}\\\\n</text>\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n \\\\ntest_tone_score = openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\n messages=[\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(\\\\n text=traces_batch[1].output),\\\\n }\\\\n ],\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\n temperature=0\\\\n).choices[0].message.content\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"User query: {traces_batch[1].input['args'][0]}\\\\\\\")\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"Model answer: {traces_batch[1].output}\\\\\\\")\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"Dominant tones: {test_tone_score}\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nIdentifying human intents and tones can be tricky for language models. To handle this, we used a multi-shot prompt, which means giving the model several examples to learn from. Now let\\\\u2019s wrap our code in an evaluation function for convenience.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\ndef tone_score(trace):\\\\n return openai.chat.completions.create(\\\\n messages=[\\\\n {\\\\n \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": template_tone_eval.format(text=trace.output),\\\\n }\\\\n ],\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\",\\\\n temperature=0\\\\n ).choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\ntone_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\n```\\\\nGreat! Now let\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\u2019 score.\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\n \\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\",\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\",\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\n )\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\"],\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\n \\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\")\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n return {\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\n \\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\n```\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\nNow we\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\u2019s time to put them to work. Use the Langfuse client to add scores to existing traces.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nlangfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=traces_batch[1].id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\nAnd thus, you\\\\u2019ve added your first externally-evaluated score to Langfuse! Just 49 more to go \\\\ud83d\\\\ude01. But don\\\\u2019t worry \\\\u2014 our solutions are easy to scale.\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\. Putting everything together\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nUntil now, we went through each of the necessary steps to build an external evaluation pipeline: Fetching traces, running the evaluations, and persisting the scores to Langfuse. Let\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up. Batching not only reduces the memory load on your system but also allows you to create checkpoints, so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport math\\\\n \\\\nfor page_number in range(1, math.ceil(TOTAL_TRACES/BATCH_SIZE)):\\\\n \\\\n traces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\n page=page_number,\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\n to_timestamp=five_am_today,\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE\\\\n ).data\\\\n \\\\n for trace in traces_batch:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Processing {trace.name}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n if trace.output is None:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Warning: \\\\\\\\n Trace {trace.name} had no generated output, \\\\\\\\\\\\n it was skipped\\\\\\\")\\\\n continue\\\\n \\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=tone_score(trace)\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n jscore = joyfulness_score(trace)\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"joyfulness\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=jscore[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=jscore[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Batch {page_number} processed \\\\ud83d\\\\ude80 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nIf your pipeline ran successfully, you should see your score in the Langfuse UI. \\\\nAnd that\\\\u2019s it! You\\\\u2019re now ready to integrate these lines into your preferred orchestration tool to ensure they run at the right times.\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nTo achieve our original goal of running the script every day at 5 am, simply schedule a Cron task in your chosen environment with the rule `cron(0 5 * * ? *)`.\\\\nThanks for coding along!

When JsonPath is empty, the backend uses the top-level value as-is, but if the field is a string and the mapping expects an object (or vice versa), the item is excluded from evaluation\\\\u00a0[see code logic](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/98cc1bb7a1759e29de3dd818f6a500df48fb5e82/worker/src/features/evaluation/evalService.ts).\\\\n\\\\nTry this: map all variables to fields you know are plain strings (like Input or Expected Output) and see if the evaluation processes any items. If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath. This will help isolate the problem.\\\\n\\\\nIf you still get 0 elements, export a sample of your dataset as JSON and share it\\\\u2014there may be a subtle data or mapping mismatch. \\\\n\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nMore details on dataset item structure and mapping: [Langfuse docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/get-started).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\\\\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n<sup>How did I do?

\\\"Evaluation of LLM Applications - Langfuse\\\\nDocsEvaluationOverview\\\\nCopy as Markdown\\\\n# Evaluation Overview\\\\nEvaluation is a critical aspect of developing and deploying LLM applications. Usually, teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods to score the performance of their AI application depending on the use case and the stage of the development process.\\\\n\\\\ud83c\\\\udfa5\\\\n[ **Watch this walkthrough**](/watch-demo?tab=evaluation) of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\\\\n## Why use LLM Evaluation?\\\\nLLM evaluation is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, ultimately enhancing the user experience and trust in your AI application. Here are the key benefits:\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic evaluation\\\\n  * **Risk Mitigation** : Catch potential issues before they reach production users, reducing the likelihood of poor user experiences or reputational damage\\\\n## Online & Offline Evaluation\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy metrics since you have ground truth.\\\\n**Online

The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.\\\\n**How`item.run()` works:**\\\\nWhen you use `with item.run(run_name=\\\\\\\"your_eval_run_name\\\\\\\") as root_span:`:\\\\n  1. **Trace Creation** : A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.\\\\n  2. **Trace Naming & Metadata**: \\\\n    * The trace is automatically named (e.g., \\\\u201cDataset run: your_eval_run_name\\\\u201d).\\\\n    * Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.\\\\n  3. **DatasetRunItem Linking** : The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links: \\\\n    * The `dataset_item_id`\\\\n    * The `trace_id` of the newly created trace\\\\n    * The provided `run_name`\\\\n    * Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`. This linkage is what populates the \\\\u201cRuns\\\\u201d tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.\\\\n  4. **Contextual Span** : The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.\\\\n  5. **Automatic Nesting** : Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\n \\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\ndataset_name = \\\\\\\"qna-eval\\\\\\\"\\\\ncurrent_run_name = \\\\\\\"qna_model_v3_run_05_20\\\\\\\" # Identifies this specific evaluation run\\\\n \\\\n///# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):\\\\n with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"qna-llm-call\\\\\\\",\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n metadata={\\\\\\\"item_id\\\\\\\": item_id, \\\\\\\"run\\\\\\\": run_name}, ///# Example metadata for the generation\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4o\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as generation:\\\\n # Simulate LLM call\\\\n answer = f\\\\\\\"Answer to '{question}' using context.\\\\\\\" # Replace with actual LLM call\\\\n generation.update(output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer})\\\\n \\\\n # Update the trace with the input and output\\\\n generation.update_trace(\\\\n input={\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\": question, \\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\": context},\\\\n output={\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\": answer},\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return answer\\\\n \\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) ///# Fetch your pre-populated dataset\\\\n \\\\nfor item in dataset.items:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n # Use the item.run() context manager\\\\n with item.run(\\\\n run_name=current_run_name,\\\\n run_metadata={\\\\\\\"model_provider\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"OpenAI\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"temperature_setting\\\\\\\": 0.7},\\\\n run_description=\\\\\\\"Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th\\\\\\\"\\\\n ) as root_span: ///# root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.\\\\n # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.\\\\n \\\\n # Call your application logic\\\\n generated_answer = my_qna_app(\\\\n question=item.input[\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\"],\\\\n context=item.input[\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\"],\\\\n item_id=item.id,\\\\n run_name=current_run_name\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\" Item {item.id} processed.

This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.\\\\nLast updated on August 20, 2025\\\\n[Instrumentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation \\\\\\\"Instrumentation\\\\\\\")\\\\n[Advanced usage](/docs/observability/sdk/python/advanced-usage \\\\\\\"Advanced usage\\\\\\\")\\\\nWas this page helpful?\\\\nYesNo\\\\n[Support](/support)\\\\n\\\"}], \\\"type\\\": \\\"content\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"document\\\", \\\"record_type\\\": \\\"documentation\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-11-21-all-new-datasets-and-evals-documentation\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"All new Datasets, Experimentation and Evaluation documentation\\\", \\\"source\\\": {\\\"content\\\": [{\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"## New Datasets and Evaluation documentation\\\\nBased on this week\\\\u2019s changes, we have have restructured the documentation to:\\\\n  1.

Remote Dataset Runs are used to programmatically loop your applications or prompts through a dataset and optionally apply Evaluation Methods to the results.\\\\nThey are called \\\\u201cRemote Dataset Runs\\\\u201d because they can make use of \\\\u201cremote\\\\u201d or external logic and code.\\\\nOptionally, you can also trigger Remote Dataset Runs via the Langfuse UI which will call them via a webhook.\\\\n## Why use Remote Dataset Runs?\\\\n  * Full flexibility to use your own application logic\\\\n  * Use custom scoring functions to evaluate the outputs\\\\n  * Run multiple experiments on the same dataset in parallel\\\\n  * Easy to integrate with your existing evaluation infrastructure\\\\nSequence Diagram\\\\n## Experiment runner SDK\\\\nBoth the Python and JS/TS SDKs provide a high-level abstraction for running an experiment on a dataset. The dataset can be both local or hosted on Langfuse. Using the Experiment runner is the recommended way to run an experiment on a dataset with our SDK.\\\\nThe experiment runner automatically handles:\\\\n  * **Concurrent execution** of tasks with configurable limits\\\\n  * **Automatic tracing** of all executions for observability\\\\n  * **Flexible evaluation** with both item-level and run-level evaluators\\\\n  * **Error isolation** so individual failures don\\\\u2019t stop the experiment\\\\n  * **Dataset integration** for easy comparison and tracking\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nThe experiment runner SDK supports both datasets hosted on Langfuse and datasets hosted locally. If you are using a dataset hosted on Langfuse for your experiment, the SDK will automatically create a dataset run for you that you can inspect and compare in the Langfuse UI. For locally hosted datasets not on Langfuse, only traces and scores (if evaluations are used) are tracked in Langfuse.\\\\n### Basic Usage\\\\nStart with the simplest possible experiment to test your task function on local data. If you already have a dataset in Langfuse, see here.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import get_client\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import OpenAI\\\\n \\\\n///# Initialize client\\\\nlangfuse = get_client()\\\\n \\\\n///# Define your task function\\\\ndef my_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\n question = item[\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\"]\\\\n response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\", messages=[{\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": question}]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment on local data\\\\nlocal_data = [\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n {\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\"},\\\\n]\\\\n \\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=local_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\nMake sure that OpenTelemetry is properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { NodeSDK } from \\\\\\\"@opentelemetry/sdk-node\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\nimport {\\\\n LangfuseClient,\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n ExperimentTask,\\\\n ExperimentItem,\\\\n} from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/client\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { observeOpenAI } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from \\\\\\\"@langfuse/otel\\\\\\\";\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize OpenTelemetry\\\\nconst otelSdk = new NodeSDK({ spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()] });\\\\notelSdk.start();\\\\n \\\\n// Initialize client\\\\nconst langfuse = new LangfuseClient();\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment on local data\\\\nconst localData: ExperimentItem[] = [\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of France?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n { input: \\\\\\\"What is the capital of Germany?\\\\\\\" },\\\\n];\\\\n \\\\n// Define your task function\\\\nconst myTask: ExperimentTask = async (item) => {\\\\n const question = item.input;\\\\n \\\\n const response = await observeOpenAI(new OpenAI()).chat.completions.create({\\\\n model: \\\\\\\"gpt-4.1\\\\\\\",\\\\n messages: [\\\\n {\\\\n role: \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n content: question,\\\\n },\\\\n ],\\\\n });\\\\n \\\\n return response;\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Run the experiment\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Geography Quiz\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Testing basic functionality\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: localData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Print formatted result\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OTEL SDK to deliver traces\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown();\\\\n```\\\\n **Note for JS/TS SDK** : OpenTelemetry must be properly set up for traces to be delivered to Langfuse. See the [tracing setup documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup#tracing-setup) for configuration details. Always flush the span processor at the end of execution to ensure all traces are sent.\\\\nWhen running experiments on local data, only traces are created in Langfuse - no dataset runs are generated. Each task execution creates an individual trace for observability and debugging.\\\\n### Usage with Langfuse Datasets\\\\nRun experiments directly on datasets stored in Langfuse for automatic tracing and comparison.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n///# Get dataset from Langfuse\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\ndataset = langfuse.get_dataset(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nresult = dataset.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description=\\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task=my_task\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\n///# Use format method to display results\\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Get dataset from Langfuse\\\\nconst dataset = await langfuse.dataset.get(\\\\\\\"my-evaluation-dataset\\\\\\\");\\\\n \\\\n// Run experiment directly on the dataset\\\\nconst result = await dataset.runExperiment({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Production Model Test\\\\\\\",\\\\n description: \\\\\\\"Monthly evaluation of our production model\\\\\\\",\\\\n task: myTask\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\n// Use format method to display results\\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n \\\\n// Important: shut down OpenTelemetry to ensure traces are sent to Langfuse\\\\nawait otelSdk.shutdown()\\\\n```\\\\nWhen using Langfuse datasets, dataset runs are automatically created in Langfuse and are available for comparison in the UI. This enables tracking experiment performance over time and comparing different approaches on the same dataset.\\\\n### Advanced Features\\\\nEnhance your experiments with evaluators and advanced configuration options.\\\\n#### Evaluators\\\\nEvaluators assess the quality of task outputs at the item level. They receive the input, metadata, output, and expected output for each item and return evaluation metrics that are reported as scores on the traces in Langfuse.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\n \\\\n///# Define evaluation functions\\\\ndef accuracy_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, metadata, **kwargs):\\\\n if expected_output and expected_output.lower() in output.lower():\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=1.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\", value=0.0, comment=\\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\ndef length_evaluator(*, input, output, **kwargs):\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\", value=len(output), comment=f\\\\\\\"Response has {len(output)} characters\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n///# Use multiple evaluators\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator, length_evaluator]\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\n// Define evaluation functions\\\\nconst accuracyEvaluator = async ({ input, output, expectedOutput }) => {\\\\n if (expectedOutput && output.toLowerCase().includes(expectedOutput.toLowerCase())) {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 1.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Correct answer found\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n }\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: 0.0,\\\\n comment: \\\\\\\"Incorrect answer\\\\\\\"\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\nconst lengthEvaluator = async ({ input, output }) => {\\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"response_length\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: output.length,\\\\n comment: `Response has ${output.length} characters`\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\n// Use multiple evaluators\\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Multi-metric Evaluation\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: testData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator, lengthEvaluator]\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n```\\\\n#### Run-level Evaluators\\\\nRun-level evaluators assess the full experiment results and compute aggregate metrics. When run on Langfuse datasets, these scores are attached to the full dataset run for tracking overall experiment performance.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom langfuse import Evaluation\\\\n \\\\ndef average_accuracy(*, item_results, **kwargs):\\\\n \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Calculate average accuracy across all items\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n accuracies = [\\\\n eval.value for result in item_results\\\\n for eval in result.evaluations\\\\n if eval.name == \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\"\\\\n ]\\\\n \\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n if not accuracies:\\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\", value=None)\\\\n \\\\n avg = sum(accuracies) / len(accuracies)\\\\n \\\\n return Evaluation(name=\\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\", value=avg, comment=f\\\\\\\"Average accuracy: {avg:.2%}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Comprehensive Analysis\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=my_task,\\\\n evaluators=[accuracy_evaluator],\\\\n run_evaluators=[average_accuracy]\\\\n)\\\\n \\\\nprint(result.format())\\\\n```\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nconst averageAccuracy = async ({ itemResults }) => {\\\\n // Calculate average accuracy across all items\\\\n const accuracies = itemResults\\\\n .flatMap(result => result.evaluations)\\\\n .filter(evaluation => evaluation.name === \\\\\\\"accuracy\\\\\\\")\\\\n .map(evaluation => evaluation.value as number);\\\\n \\\\n if (accuracies.length === 0) {\\\\n return { name: \\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\", value: null };\\\\n }\\\\n \\\\n const avg = accuracies.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / accuracies.length;\\\\n \\\\n return {\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"avg_accuracy\\\\\\\",\\\\n value: avg,\\\\n comment: `Average accuracy: ${(avg * 100).toFixed(1)}%`\\\\n };\\\\n};\\\\n \\\\nconst result = await langfuse.experiment.run({\\\\n name: \\\\\\\"Comprehensive Analysis\\\\\\\",\\\\n data: testData,\\\\n task: myTask,\\\\n evaluators: [accuracyEvaluator],\\\\n runEvaluators: [averageAccuracy]\\\\n});\\\\n \\\\nconsole.log(await result.format());\\\\n```\\\\n#### Async Tasks and Evaluators\\\\nBoth task functions and evaluators can be asynchronous.\\\\nPython SDKJS/TS SDK\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport asyncio\\\\nfrom langfuse.openai import AsyncOpenAI\\\\n \\\\nasync def async_llm_task(*, item, **kwargs):\\\\n \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Async task using OpenAI\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n client = AsyncOpenAI()\\\\n response = await client.chat.completions.create(\\\\n model=\\\\\\\"gpt-4\\\\\\\",\\\\n messages=[{\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": item[\\\\\\\"input\\\\\\\"]}]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\\\n \\\\n///# Works seamlessly with async functions\\\\nresult = langfuse.run_experiment(\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Async Experiment\\\\\\\",\\\\n data=test_data,\\\\n task=async_llm_task,\\\\n max_concurrency=5 #

If your needs go beyond these, you can still implement in Langfuse custom evaluation templates without code.\\\\nConsider implementing an external evaluation pipeline if you need:\\\\n  * More control over **when** traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\\\\n  * Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond what\\\\u2019s possible with the Langfuse UI\\\\n  * Version control for your custom evaluations\\\\n  * The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks\\\\nIf your use case meets any of this situations, let\\\\u2019s go ahead and implement your first external evaluation pipeline!\\\\n* * *\\\\nBy the end of this cookbook, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n  * Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\\\\n  * Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\\\\n  * Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\\\\n  * Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\\\\nConceptually, we will implement the following architecture:\\\\n* * *\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\n**Note** : While we\\\\u2019re using a Jupyter notebook for this cookbook, in production you\\\\u2019d use your preferred orchestration tool.

Run your evaluations\\\\nLangfuse can handle numerical, boolean and categorical (`string`) scores. Wrapping your custom evaluation logic in a function is often a good practice. Evaluation functions should take a `trace` as input and yield a valid score. Let\\\\u2019s begin with a simple example using a categorical score.\\\\n### 2.1. Categoric Evaluations\\\\nWhen analyzing the outputs of your LLM applications, you may want to evaluate traits that are best defined qualitatively, such as sentiment, tonality or text complexity (Grade level).\\\\nWe\\\\u2019re building a science educator LLM that should sound engaging and positive. To ensure it hits the right notes, we\\\\u2019ll evaluate the tone of its outputs to see if they match our intent. We\\\\u2019ll draft an evaluation prompt ourselves (no library) to identify the three main tones in each model output.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\ntemplate_tone_eval = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\nYou're an expert in human emotional intelligence.

Now let\\\\u2019s go ahead and create a numeric evaluation score.\\\\n### 2.2. Numeric Evaluations\\\\nIn this cookbook, we\\\\u2019ll use the `Deepeval` framework ([docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)) to handle our numeric evaluations. Deepeval provides scores ranging from zero to one for many common LLM metrics. Plus, you can create custom metrics by simply describing them in plain language. To ensure our app\\\\u2019s responses are joyful and engaging, we\\\\u2019ll define a custom \\\\u2018joyfulness\\\\u2019 score.\\\\nYou can use any evaluation library. These are popular ones:\\\\n  * OpenAI Evals ([GitHub](https://github.com/openai/evals))\\\\n  * Langchain Evaluators\\\\n  * [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) for RAG applications\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\\\\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams, LLMTestCase\\\\n \\\\ndef joyfulness_score(trace):\\\\n joyfulness_metric = GEval(\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\\\",\\\\n criteria=\\\\\\\"Determine whether the output is engaging and fun.\\\\\\\",\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\\\\n )\\\\n test_case = LLMTestCase(\\\\n input=trace.input[\\\\\\\"args\\\\\\\"],\\\\n actual_output=trace.output)\\\\n \\\\n joyfulness_metric.measure(test_case)\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Score: {joyfulness_metric.score}\\\\\\\")\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Reason: {joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n return {\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.score, \\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\": joyfulness_metric.reason}\\\\n \\\\njoyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])\\\\n```\\\\nUnder the hood, GEval uses chain of thought (CoT) prompting to formulate a set of criteria for scoring prompts. When developing your own metrics, it\\\\u2019s important to review the reasoning behind these scores. This helps ensure that the model evaluates the traces just as you intended when you wrote the evaluation prompt.\\\\nOur eval function returns a dictionary with both the score and the model\\\\u2019s reasoning. We do this as we\\\\u2019ll persist the reasoning with every langfuse score, ensuring interpretability.\\\\nNow we\\\\u2019re done with defining our evaluation functions. Let\\\\u2019s push those scores back to Langfuse!\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\. Pushing Scores to Langfuse\\\\nNow that we have our evaluation functions ready, it\\\\u2019s time to put them to work. Use the Langfuse client to add scores to existing traces.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nlangfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=traces_batch[1].id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=joyfulness_score(traces_batch[1])[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\nAnd thus, you\\\\u2019ve added your first externally-evaluated score to Langfuse! Just 49 more to go \\\\ud83d\\\\ude01. But don\\\\u2019t worry \\\\u2014 our solutions are easy to scale.\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\. Putting everything together\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nUntil now, we went through each of the necessary steps to build an external evaluation pipeline: Fetching traces, running the evaluations, and persisting the scores to Langfuse. Let\\\\u2019s sum it up into a compact script that you could run in your evaluation pipeline.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ll fetch the data in batches of 10 traces and then iterate through each trace to score it and push the scores back to Langfuse. Note that this batch size is for demonstration purposes. In a production setup, you might want to process multiple batches in parallel to speed things up. Batching not only reduces the memory load on your system but also allows you to create checkpoints, so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n```\\\\nimport math\\\\n \\\\nfor page_number in range(1, math.ceil(TOTAL_TRACES/BATCH_SIZE)):\\\\n \\\\n traces_batch = langfuse.api.trace.list(\\\\n tags=\\\\\\\"ext_eval_pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\n page=page_number,\\\\n from_timestamp=five_am_yesterday,\\\\n to_timestamp=five_am_today,\\\\n limit=BATCH_SIZE\\\\n ).data\\\\n \\\\n for trace in traces_batch:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Processing {trace.name}\\\\\\\")\\\\n \\\\n if trace.output is None:\\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Warning: \\\\\\\\n Trace {trace.name} had no generated output, \\\\\\\\\\\\n it was skipped\\\\\\\")\\\\n continue\\\\n \\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"tone\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=tone_score(trace)\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n jscore = joyfulness_score(trace)\\\\n langfuse.create_score(\\\\n trace_id=trace.id,\\\\n name=\\\\\\\"joyfulness\\\\\\\",\\\\n value=jscore[\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\"],\\\\n comment=jscore[\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\"]\\\\n )\\\\n \\\\n print(f\\\\\\\"Batch {page_number} processed \\\\ud83d\\\\ude80 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nIf your pipeline ran successfully, you should see your score in the Langfuse UI. \\\\nAnd that\\\\u2019s it! You\\\\u2019re now ready to integrate these lines into your preferred orchestration tool to ensure they run at the right times.\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nTo achieve our original goal of running the script every day at 5 am, simply schedule a Cron task in your chosen environment with the rule `cron(0 5 * * ? *)`.\\\\nThanks for coding along!

If it works, the issue is with the Metadata field's type. To confirm, create a dataset item where Metadata is a JSON object (e.g., {\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\"}) and try mapping with and without a JsonPath.

applications. Usually, teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods to score the performance of their AI application depending on the use case and the stage of the development process.\\\\n\\\\ud83c\\\\udfa5\\\\n[ **Watch this walkthrough**](/watch-demo?tab=evaluation) of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.\\\\n## Why use LLM Evaluation?\\\\nLLM evaluation is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, ultimately enhancing the user experience and trust in your AI application. Here are the key benefits:\\\\n  * **Quality Assurance** : Detect hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistent outputs to ensure your AI app delivers reliable results\\\\n  * **Performance Monitoring** : Measure response quality, relevance, and user satisfaction across different scenarios and edge cases\\\\n  * **Continuous Improvement** : Identify areas for enhancement and track improvements over time through structured evaluation metrics\\\\n  * **User Trust** : Build confidence in your AI application by demonstrating consistent, high-quality outputs through systematic

Evaluation\\\\n**Offline Evaluation involves**\\\\n  * Evaluating the application in a controlled setting\\\\n  * Typically using curated test Datasets instead of live user queries\\\\n  * Heavily used during development (can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to measure improvements / regressions\\\\n  * Repeatable and you can get clear accuracy metrics since you have ground truth.\\\\n**Online

Your goal: give the correct, actionable answer with links and minimal, runnable examples.\\\\n\\\\n## Guidelines\\\\n- Make extensive use of the tools provided to you in order to search the langfuse documentation.\\\\n- Getting an overview of the docs is almost always a good idea for on-topic questions.\\\\n- Answer the question using only this and only this information, outputted in markdown format.\\\\n- Before using any tools, reason about what kinds of tools make the most sense to be helpful.\\\\n- After tool responses, reason about whether the information is sufficient to answer a question; if not, use the tools again or give up and state that you don't know.\\\\n- If a user asks where the traces/logs of the conversation they have with you are ending up, please refer to the Langfuse Demo Project: (EU Data region: https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/clkpwwm0m000gmm094odg11gi/traces, US Data region: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/project/cmeic4yr500qmad0772bw0tol/traces)\\\\n\\\\n## Scope & Safety\\\\n- Only answer questions about Langfuse, its SDKs, integrations, evaluation, tracing, observability, and adjacent LLM-app topics.\\\\n- If the question is not about Langfuse/LLM-apps, politely decline and suggest a relevant Langfuse topic instead.\\\\n\\\\n## Clarifying Questions\\\\n- If the question is broad/underspecified, ask one targeted clarifying question before executing tools (e.g., “Which SDK are you using - Python or JS/TS?”).\\\\n\\\\n## Pricing & Discounts\\\\n- Do not restate prices from memory. Link to `https://langfuse.com/pricing`. If not retrievable, say you can’t confirm and point to contacting support.\\\\n\\\\n## Markdown Style Guide\\\\n- **Headings:** Start with a single H1 title, then H2 sections (`##`), H3 for subsections only.\\\\n- **Bullets vs code:** Never put multi-line code inside list items. Use **separate fenced blocks** with language hints.\\\\n- **Code fences:** Use `bash`, `ini` (or `env`), `python`, `ts`, `json`. One purpose per block (install, env, file, run).\\\\n- **Filenames:** Show the intended filename in a short caption line before the block, e.g., `_hello.py_`.\\\\n- **Links:** Use descriptive markdown links for every doc reference; no bare URLs. Prefer canonical anchors.\\\\n- **Tables:** Use a 2-column table for environment variables (`Name | Value (example)`).\\\\n- **Sections to include (if relevant):** *Prerequisites* → *Setup* → *Minimal Example* → *Run* → *Troubleshooting* → *Links*.\\\\n- **Copy-ready:** Commands and examples must be copy-pastable with placeholders clearly marked like `<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>`.\\\\n- **Keep it tight:** ≤ 20 lines of code per SDK section. If longer, collapse details or link out.\\\",\\\"version\\\":10,\\\"isFallback\\\":false,\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"labels\\\":[\\\"production\\\",\\\"latest\\\"],\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"config\\\":{\\\"model\\\":\\\"gpt-5\\\",\\\"reasoningSummary\\\":\\\"detailed\\\",\\\"textVerbosity\\\":\\\"low\\\",\\\"reasoningEffort\\\":\\\"low\\\"}}\"",
